    "A short introduction to Python functions. In this tutorial we will learn the basic Python syntax including function declaration, inputs, outputs, and documentation (called docstring).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions allow us to re-use code that does something specific. In simple terms, functions are snippets of code associated to a name, so that we can call them by their name everytime we need them. They are helpful to avoid repeating the same lines of code all over the program we are building. Functions also allow us to reduce error (we don't have to type everything again) and add documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions make our code more modular. This modularity applies to the current project and may extend to other projects, which means that useful functions that emerge from one project can be used in future projects. The power pf functions comes when you start building your own library of functions. They are one of the most valuable assets in scientific programming.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Functions are like tools in a toolbox, they serve or perform a well defined task and can be re-used multiple times. You grab a tool when you need it and you move on onto the next task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an analogy, think of functions as a wrench or a screwdriver everytime you have to adjust a nut or tight up a screw. However, to use a wrench or screwdriver you first have to go and buy it at the hardware store. You can only use a tool that is at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to understand functions we need to split the process into two steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: define/declare the function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: call/invoke the function\n"

That part will occur when we call or invoke the function in the second step. In simple words, declaring a function is like encapsulating some code under a specific name. "
